Plug-ins
========

`gulp-component-assembler` supports plug-ins to allow anyone to update the output generated by the `assemble` process.

To view the list of predefined plug-ins go to the [PLUGINLIST.md file](PLUGINLIST.MD).

# Load a predefined plug-in

To load a plugin that `gulp-component-assembler` defines, use `loadPlugin` and pass in the name of the plugin you want to load.

```JS
  compasm.loadPlugin('fileNameProvider');
```

# How to write a plug-in

There are two steps to writing your own plug-in.

The first step is to create a function which takes in the `params` object, processes whatever it needs to process, and returns a `string`. This `string` is then added to the output of the component in the location indicated when you registered the plug-in.

The second step is to export a function that takes in a `register` function and a list of plug-in `types`. The function should call `register` and pass it the first function you created, the plug-in type to indicate when you want the plug-in to be processed, and the name of your plugin.

A plug-in must return a string that contains JavaScript compliant code. Your string is added to the component output file, which is a JavaScript file. So be cautious with your output.

Here is a simple example of a plug-in:

```js
function pluginProcess(params, plugInType) {
  return "// This is from my plug-in of type `"+ plugInType +"`\n"; // This will add the comment into the output file
}

module.exports = function(register, types) {
  // register this plugin and process it before each assembly
  register(pluginProcess, types.BEFORE_ASSEMBLY, 'myPlugin');
};
```

Then, to use your plug-in you need to include your plug-in in your project and add the following in your `gulpfile.js` file:

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var myPlugin = require('path/to/your/plug-in');
var compasm = require('gulp-component-assembler');

gulp.task('assemble', function() {
  compasm.loadPlugin(myPlugin);

  return gulp.src('./assembly.json')
    .pipe(compasm.assemble())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist'));
});
```

### Plug-in types

| Plug-in Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `BEFORE` | BEFORE plug-ins are processed *before* the entire file is processed. The output is placed at the top of the output file, before any other content. |
| `beforeASSEMBLY` |  BEFORE\_ASSEMBLY plug-ins are processed *before* each assembly file is processed. Its output is placed just inside the IIFE. |
| `BEFORE_JS_FILE` | BEFORE\_JS\_FILE plug-ins are processed *before* each JavaScript file is processed. Its output is placed just before the inclusion of a file. |
| `AFTER_JS_FILE` | AFTER\_JS\_FILE plug-ins are processed *after* each JavaScript file is processed.  Its output is placed just after the inclusion of a file. |
| `AFTER_ASSEMBLY` | AFTER\_ASSEMBLY plug-ins are processed *after* each assembly file is processed. Its output is placed just before the end of the IIFE. |
| `AFTER` | AFTER plug-ins are processed *after* the entire file is processed. The output is placed at the bottom of the output file, after all other content. |

> #### Sample output file

> The example output file below shows where each of the plug-in's output in injected:

> ```js
// Assembly: sampleAssembly
// Plugin: all.BEFORE
console.log('plugin code called for `BEFORE`');

> (function(window, document, undefined) {

>   // Plugin: all.BEFORE_ASSEMBLY
  console.log('plugin code called for `BEFORE_ASSEMBLY`');

>   /*
   * Included File: src/test1.js
   */
  // Plugin: all.BEFORE_JS_FILE
  console.log('plugin code called for `BEFORE_JS_FILE`');

>  function sampleFunction() {
    return false;
  }
  // Plugin: all.AFTER_JS_FILE
  console.log('plugin code called for `AFTER_JS_FILE`');

>  /*
   * Included File: src/test2.js
   */
  // Plugin: all.BEFORE_JS_FILE
  console.log('plugin code called for `BEFORE_JS_FILE`');

>  function fileTest2Js() {
    return "File: test2.js";
  }
  // Plugin: all.AFTER_JS_FILE
  console.log('plugin code called for `AFTER_JS_FILE`');

>  // Plugin: all.AFTER_ASSEMBLY
  console.log('plugin code called for `AFTER_ASSEMBLY`');

>})(window, document);
// Plugin: all.AFTER
console.log('plugin code called for `AFTER`');
```

### The `plugInType` object passed into your plug-in function

The `plug-in type`, from above, that indicates when this function was called. _Your function can use or ignore this parameter._

### The `params` object passed into your plug-in function

The `params` object is passed into your plug-in function and includes the following properties:

##### Property: projectPath - *{string}*
>This is the absolute path, at the time of assembly, to the folder that contains your assembly.json file.

##### Property: hasTranslations - *{boolean}*
>`hasTranslations` is `true` if there are any valid languages files being processed by this component.

##### Property: options - *{object}*
>The `options` object passed into the `assemble` function in your file `gulpfile.js`.

##### Property: assembly - *{object}*
>The JSON assembly object that is being processed at this time. This is the object that contains all of the properties found in the `assembly.json` file, including `files`, `templates`, `subs`, etc. 

##### Property: assemblyFileName - *{string}*
>This is the name of the assembly that is being built minus the `.js` extension. Normally this is the name of the folder that contains the `assembly.json` file.

#### Your own properties in the `assembly.json` file
You can add your own properties into the `assembly.json` file but *please*, in order to reduce the likelihood of name collisions, use name-spacing on all your variable. To do this, preface your variable names with a name that defines your plug-in.

*For example:* If your plug-in is called "banjo" then all of your properties should start with "banjo\_" as in the example below:

```js
{
  "files": [ "**/*.js" ],
  "banjo_classes": ["outer", "inner"],
  "banjo_title": "Lost and Found"
}
```

You access the above properties in your plug-in by reading the variables `params.assembly.banjo_classes` and `params.assembly.banjo_title`.

> **Note:** _If you are not planning to use 3rd party plug-ins and don't plan to make your plug-ins available to others then name-spacing is not as important. **But be aware of the name collision risks of not name-spacing.**_

> To simplify access to your properties avoid using non-variable characters in your property names like [\`, !, -, +, =, etc.] otherwise you will need to access your properties like this: `params.assembly['banjo!classes']`
> 


### Plug-in Error Handling

When your plug-in encounters an error condition your code has two options:

1 Ignore the error and **return nothing** which will add nothing to the output

```js
function pluginProcess(params) {
  var error = false;

  // Your logic here

  if (!error) {
    return "// Real string to add to output";
  }
}

module.exports = function(register, types) {
  register(pluginProcess, types.BEFORE_ASSEMBLY, 'myPlugin');
};
```

2 The error is catastrophic so you should **throw an exception** which will terminate your gulp process. You must throw an instance of the `PluginError` object.

```js
var PluginError = require('plugin-error');

function pluginProcess(params) {
  if (!params.assembly.files || params.assembly.files.length < 1) {
    throw new PluginError("my plugin", "You must supply a list of files");
  }

  return "// Real string to add to output";
}

module.exports = function(register, types) {
  register(pluginProcess, types.BEFORE_ASSEMBLY, 'myPlugin');
};
```
